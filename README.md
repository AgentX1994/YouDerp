# YouDerp for Chrome

A simple Chrome extension that converts the annoying YouTube comments section into a sea of herps, derps, blahs, or whatever you desire.

The options consist of the predefined "herpderp" and "blahblah" settings, or a custom word/phrase list. The contents of the text area is expected to be a comma-separated list of words or phrases, and each word or phrase is treated as a single unit.

Inspired by [HerpDerp for YouTube by Tanner Stokes][http://www.tannr.com/herp-derp-youtube-comments/], which I felt could be improved with a little bit of customization.
